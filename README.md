# Gift Exchange API

An API for generating a smooth gift exchange selection experience. No more having to redraw, or switch names because there weren't any others in the pot.

### How it works

A user creates a family group, and adds each member to the group. When it's time to select names for the gift exchange, members of the same family will not be paired together. User's will also be able to block a pairing from occuring manually between two members not in the same family group.
